**Note: The data below is test data and built using a league from last year. You will see your team
reflected at some point after the draft.**

Below you wil find the full league schedule for both the ESPN league and the Blacktop Battle Royale (default).
During Sunday, the schedule will be updated with the latest scores and stats on a 10 minute frequency so 
that you can see how your team is doing in real-time against your Blacktop Royale opponent. If the data
does not tie to your ESPN app it could be due to the 10 minute delay. If it looks like it is not 
related to the delay, please reach out to Tony T.
