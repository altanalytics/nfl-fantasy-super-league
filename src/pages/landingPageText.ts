## 🔁 Standard Fantasy Football (a.k.a. The ESPN Part)

You're still playing standard fantasy football — nothing wild here.  
Each participant has a team in their **respective ESPN league**.  
You’ll draft, set your lineup, and manage waivers *as usual.*

**League Details:**
- 12 teams per league
- 14-week regular season
- 3-week playoffs (top 6 teams make it; top 2 get a first-round bye)

### 🏆 ESPN League Prizes

| Award | Prize |
|-------|-------|
| **1st Place** | Parent + Child get *matching jerseys* of the child’s choice |
| **2nd Place** | The child gets a jersey of their choice — the parent watches in conflicted pride |
| **3rd Place** | You each get \$1 |
| **Most Points** | Parent + Child get *matching hats*... of the parent’s choosing (power move) |

*Most points scored is based on the regular season only*

🧑‍💻 Tony T. will handle all administrative duties through email with each league separately:  
draft coordination, trades, league drama, and rule enforcement.

## 🤼 The Blacktop Battle Royale (This Is the Fun Part)

Here’s where it gets interesting.

The **Blacktop Battle Royale** is a **weekly inter-league showdown**:  
each team from *Minivan Mayhem* will face a team from *Snacktime Bandits*.
This means every week, you’ll have two matchups:
1. **Your ESPN League**: Standard fantasy football as usual.
2. **The Battle Royale**: A head-to-head matchup against a team from the other league.

> **Important:**  
> No second roster. No extra setup.  
> All scoring comes from your existing ESPN lineup.
> *There is nothing extra you need to do*. 
> This site simply tracks the Battle Royale action.

Every week, you'll accumulate **wins, losses, and points scored** in both your ESPN league *and* the Battle Royale.

While the ESPN league will follow the schedule laid out above, the Blacktop Battle Royale will be slightly different.
At the end of **Week 12**, the top 7 teams from each league will be seeded playoff-style based ONLY on their Battle Royale performance:
- Rankings are based on **record** and **points** (points will obviously be the same, but record will differ)
- Top team in each conference gets a **first-round bye**
- Battle Royale playoffs begin **Week 13**
- **Week 16** = *The Blacktop Battle Championship*

### 🏆 The Blacktop Battle Championship
The top team from each conference will face off for ultimate glory in Week 16 (a week before the ESPN league ends).  
**The two winners are not necessarily the same as the top two teams in the ESPN league.**
The winner is crowned **Blacktop Battle Royale Champion** and receives:

- A **trophy**
- Eternal bragging rights
- Probably a 9-minute standing ovation at pickup

### 👕 Conference Prizes

At the end of the regular season (week 12), the **conference with the most wins overall** will receive:
- **Parent + Child Victory T-Shirts**  
- And the right to trash-talk the other conference until next August
