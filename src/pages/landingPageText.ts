## Welcome to the First Ever Cross League Battle between the Minivan Mayhem and the Snacktime Bandits!

This is the official site for the Blacktop Battle Royale Fantasy Football League. 
But it's not live yet, so please check back later for updates.

As a quick preview - this will be a league that pitts two conferences, 12 teams each against each other!
No one is friends here, and the only thing that matters is winning. Within Conferences you will duel it out to see
who wins outright! Those winnders will get Jerseys paid for the by the conference losers. 

Throughout the season, each team will play two games each week, the one assigned by ESPN for 
your in converence matchup, and the other against a team from the other conference. That is where this site comes in.
We will handle and track those matchups here. The winning conference will get t-shirts paid for by the losing conference.

The grand finale will be a final showdown between the two conference winners, this will be the first ever
Blowhole Bowl, and the winner will keep the Blowhole Trophy until the next season.
